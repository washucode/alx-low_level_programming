### TASKS

0.[ Positive anything is better than negative nothing](https://github.com/washucode/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/0-positive_or_negative.c) :
> This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.
> You can find the source code [here](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/rrqNDWjrCWdARnWFLPExPw)

1. [The last Digit](https://github.com/washucode/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/1-last_digit.c) :
>This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.

2. [I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game](https://github.com/washucode/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/2-print_alphabet.c) :
> Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
> You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etcâ€¦) is forbidden)
> All your code should be in the main function

3. [3. alphABET](https://github.com/washucode/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/3-print_alphabets.c) :
>Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.

4. [When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off](https://github.com/washucode/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/4-print_alphabt.c) :

> Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
>Print all the letters except q and e

5. [Numbers](https://github.com/washucode/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/5-print_numbers) :
> Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.


6. [Numberz](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):
> Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

7. [Smile in the mirror](https://github.com/washucode/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/7-print_tebahpla.c) :
> Write a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line

8. [Hexadecimal](https://github.com/washucode/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/8-print_base16.c) :
> Write a program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.

9. [Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success](https://github.com/washucode/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/9-print_comb.c):
>Write a program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.

10. [Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need](https://github.com/washucode/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/100-print_comb3.c) :
> Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.

11. [The success combination in business is: Do what you do better... and: do more of what you do...](https://github.com/washucode/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/101-print_comb4.c) :
